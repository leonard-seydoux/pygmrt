# Feature Specification: Python package to fetch and download GMRT tiles

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-python`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a python package that fetchs and downloads tiles from the gmrt website. it should must as simple as possible (less files, less function) but still complete allow to select different save formats, resolutions, etc. the input from the user should also contain bbox."

## Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution) *(mandatory)*

- Code Quality: Public API must be documented with clear inputs/outputs and error modes. Keep
  complexity low with a single primary entry point. Repository lint/format and static/type
  checks run in CI, blocking merges on violations.
- Testing: Coverage target >= 80% overall and no decrease on changed files. Include unit tests for
  parameter validation and result manifest, and an integration test for a known small bounding box
  (network-dependent tests may be opt-in but must exist).
- UX Consistency: Provide a single, simple entry point with named parameters for bbox, format,
  resolution, and destination folder. Use consistent parameter names and clear, actionable error
  messages.
- Performance Budgets: For a small bbox (≤ 2° x 2°), median download completes ≤ 10 seconds on a
  standard broadband connection; memory usage remains within typical package norms without excessive
  buffering. Avoid >20% regression once a baseline is established.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Download tiles for a bounding box (Priority: P1)

As a researcher, I provide a geographic bounding box and a destination folder, and I receive the
corresponding GMRT tiles saved to disk using default format and resolution.

**Why this priority**: Core value—enables immediate data access with minimal configuration.

**Independent Test**: Provide a small known bbox; after execution, files exist in the destination and
the result manifest lists each saved file and its geographic coverage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a valid bbox and destination, When I request a download with defaults, Then the tiles for the
   area are saved and a manifest is returned listing file paths and coverage.
2. Given an invalid bbox (min/max reversed), When I request a download, Then I receive a clear error
   indicating the validation failure and nothing is written.
3. Given a network outage mid-download, When I retry, Then previously complete files are reused and
   incomplete or corrupt files are replaced.

---

### User Story 2 - Choose output format and resolution (Priority: P2)

As a researcher, I can select the output file format and resolution appropriate for my workflow.

**Why this priority**: Supports downstream tooling and storage constraints.

**Independent Test**: Provide a small bbox with selected format and resolution; verify resulting files
have the requested format and approximate resolution characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a bbox and format = GeoTIFF, When I download, Then output files are GeoTIFF with correct
   extension and readable metadata.
2. Given a bbox and a lower resolution selection, When I download, Then fewer/lower-detail tiles are
   saved consistent with the requested level.
3. Given an unsupported format, When I request a download, Then I receive a clear error listing
   supported options.

---

### User Story 3 - Batch requests (Priority: P3)

As a researcher, I can pass multiple bboxes in one call and receive all corresponding tiles saved,
with a combined manifest.

**Why this priority**: Improves productivity for multi-area workflows without increasing package
complexity.

**Independent Test**: Provide two small bboxes; verify both sets of files are saved and the manifest
indexes them separately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given multiple bboxes, When I execute a batch download, Then files for each bbox are saved and the
   manifest groups entries by bbox.
2. Given one invalid bbox among several, When I execute, Then the operation reports the failing bbox
   clearly and continues/aborts per a specified policy.

### Edge Cases

- Zero-area bbox or bbox outside supported coverage → validation error with guidance.
- bbox crossing the antimeridian → behavior defined by FR-010 (see Requirements).
- Very large bbox (e.g., > 20° span) → warn about size, allow with confirmation flag in API.
- Destination folder not writable or insufficient disk space → clear error and no partial files left.
- Existing files with same names → deterministic naming and configurable overwrite behavior.
- Service rate-limits or timeouts → backoff/retry and meaningful error reporting.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The package MUST accept a bounding box input in the form [minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat]
  in WGS84 degrees; validate ordering and ranges (lon ∈ [-180, 180], lat ∈ [-90, 90]).
- FR-002: The package MUST download GMRT tiles that intersect the bbox and save them to a user-provided
  destination folder; it MUST return a manifest containing saved file paths and their coverage bounds.
- FR-003: Users MUST be able to select an output format from a supported set: GeoTIFF (default) and
  PNG. Requests for other formats MUST return a clear error listing supported options.
- FR-004: Users MUST be able to select resolution using named levels: "low", "medium", "high". The
  implementation MUST map these names to service-specific levels and document the mapping.
- FR-005: The package MUST provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid inputs, network errors,
  and permission issues.
- FR-006: The package MUST support batch input of multiple bboxes in a single call and include which
  files map to which bbox in the manifest.
- FR-007: The package MUST avoid leaving corrupt/partial files on failure; incomplete downloads MUST not
  appear as successful entries in the manifest.
- FR-008: Overwrite behavior MUST be configurable (skip, overwrite); default is skip with manifest
  indicating which files were reused.
- FR-009: The package MUST use a deterministic naming scheme for output files that reflects format and
  geographic coverage, and document that scheme in the API reference.
- FR-010: If the bbox crosses the antimeridian (minLon > maxLon by wrap-around), the request MUST be
  handled automatically by splitting into two longitudinal ranges and merging results transparently.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- BoundingBox: minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat (WGS84 degrees)
- DownloadRequest: bbox or list of bboxes; format; resolution; destination; overwrite policy
- DownloadResult: manifest entries: file path, format, bbox coverage, size, and status (created/reused)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: Users can successfully download tiles for a 2° x 2° bbox with defaults in ≤ 10 seconds (median).
- SC-002: 100% of invalid bbox inputs are detected with clear error messages before any network calls.
- SC-003: 95% of downloads across 20 test bboxes succeed on first attempt under normal conditions.
- SC-004: Download result includes a manifest enumerating files with coverage that matches the requested
  bbox within one tile resolution.
- SC-005: The public API surface remains minimal (one primary entry point plus simple data types),
  enabling new users to accomplish a download within 5 minutes using the README.

### Quality Gates Evidence

- Lint/format and static/type checks: Enforced by repository CI; spec lists inputs/outputs and error
  modes for public API to enable doc generation.
- Test coverage results: Target >= 80%; include failing regression tests for any bugs fixed later.
- UX contract review: Parameters named consistently (bbox, format, resolution, destination, overwrite).
- Performance validation: Provide measurement method and baseline after first implementation; ensure no
  >20% regression on critical paths without explicit waiver.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions

- Users can provide bbox in WGS84 decimal degrees and understand basic geospatial concepts.
- The GMRT service provides a stable public endpoint for tile retrieval and allows programmatic access
  for research/educational use.
- Default output format is GeoTIFF unless otherwise specified by the user.

### Dependencies

- Availability of the GMRT data service and network connectivity.
- Sufficient disk space and file system permissions at the destination path.
