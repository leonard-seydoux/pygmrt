Gallery Examples
================

This gallery showcases practical applications of pygmrt for downloading
and visualizing Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) data.

Each example demonstrates different features and use cases:

- **Basic visualization**: Simple download and plotting workflows
- **Advanced techniques**: Hillshading, custom colormaps, and cartopy integration  
- **Resolution comparison**: Understanding quality vs. performance trade-offs
- **Real-world applications**: Volcanic topography, bathymetry analysis

All examples use real GMRT data and can be run independently.
